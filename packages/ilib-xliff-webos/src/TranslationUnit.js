     * Construct a new translation unit The options may be undefined, which represents
     * a new, clean TranslationUnit instance.
     *
     * If the required properties are not given, the constructor throws an exception.<p>
     *
     * For newly extracted strings, there is no target text yet. There must be a target
     * locale for the translators to use when creating new target text, however. This
     * means that there may be multiple translation units in a file with the same
     * source locale and no target text, but different target locales.
     *
     * @constructor
     * @param {Object} options options to initialize the unit, or undefined for a new empty unit
     * @param {string} options.source source text for this unit
     * @param {string} options.sourceLocale the source locale spec for this unit
     * @param {string} options.key the unique resource key for this translation unit
     * @param {string} options.file path to the original source code file that contains the
     * source text of this translation unit
     * @param {string} [options.target] target text for this unit
     * @param {string} [options.targetLocale] the target locale spec for this unit
     * @param {string} [options.project] the project that this string/unit is part of
     * @param {string} [options.resType] type of this resource (string, array, plural)
     * @param {string} [options.state] the state of the current unit
     * @param {string} [options.comment] the translator's comment for this unit
     * @param {string} [options.datatype] the source of the data of this unit
     * @param {string} [options.flavor] the flavor that this string comes from
     * @param {boolean} [options.translate] flag that tells whether to translate this unit
     * @param {Object} [options.location] the line and character location of the start of this
     * translation unit in the xml representation of the file
     * @param {Object} [options.extended] extended properties for this unit. This is an object that
     * can contain any additional properties that are not explicitly defined in
     * this class. This is useful for storing additional metadata about the
     * translation unit that may be specific to a particular application or
     * use case.
     * @param {string} [options.resfile] the resource file that this unit came from. The file
     * property is the path to the file in the source code where the
     * resource was originally extracted from before it was put in the resource
     * file, and this property is the path to the resource file that contains this
     * translation unit. This is always the same as the xliff file that is currently
     * being processed. The resfile property is only set when the xliff file is
     * created from parsing a resource file. It is undefined when the xliff file is
     * created from parsing a string or when the xliff is new and being created
     * from scratch.
