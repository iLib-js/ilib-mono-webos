# xliff_split_merge.sh
This Bash script provides utilities for managing XLIFF files used in localization workflows.  
It supports merging and splitting operations across multiple components and languages using the loctool.js utility.

## Features
*Merge*: Combine current and input XLIFF files into a unified output.  
*Merge by Language*: Merge XLIFF files for the same language across multiple apps.  
*Split by Component*: Split merged XLIFF files into individual components.

## Requirements
Node.js  
loctool.js (automatically located from ../../node_modules/.pnpm)
## Usage
```
./xliff_split_merge.sh <COMMAND> <INPUT_DIR> [OUTPUT_DIR] [CURRENT_DIR (only for merge)]
```
### Commands
#### 1. merge
Merges XLIFF files from INPUT_DIR with those in CURRENT_DIR, saving results to OUTPUT_DIR.
```
./xliff_split_merge.sh merge <INPUT_DIR> <OUTPUT_DIR> <CURRENT_DIR>
```
#### 2. merge_language
Merges XLIFF files for the same language across multiple apps in INPUT_DIR.
```
./xliff_split_merge.sh merge_language <INPUT_DIR> [OUTPUT_DIR]
```
If OUTPUT_DIR is not specified, it defaults to '<INPUT_DIR>--results'.
#### 3. split_component
Splits merged XLIFF files in INPUT_DIR into separate components and saves them to OUTPUT_DIR.
```
./xliff_split_merge.sh split_component <INPUT_DIR> [OUTPUT_DIR]
```
If OUTPUT_DIR is not specified, it defaults to <INPUT_DIR>--results.
## Directory Structure
INPUT_DIR: Directory containing source .xliff files.  
OUTPUT_DIR: Directory where processed files will be saved.  
CURRENT_DIR: Directory containing current .xliff files (used only in merge).
## Notes
The script automatically locates loctool.js from the pnpm node_modules directory.  
It ensures output directories are created if they do not exist.  
Skips merging if corresponding input files are missing.
## Example
```
./xliff_split_merge.sh merge_language ./localization-data ./output_merge_language
```
This merges all xliff files for each language across multiple apps in ./localization-data and saves them to ./output_merge_language.
